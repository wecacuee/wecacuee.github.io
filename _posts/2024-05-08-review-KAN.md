On Apr 30, 2024, Komogorov-Arnold Networks paper appears on ArXiV and by May 7th, I have heard about this paper from multiple students, from whom I do not hear about new papers.
It must be special, I thought.
I decided to take a look.
I make 4 major critques of the paper
  1. MLPs have learnable activation functions as well
  2. The content of the paper does not justify the name, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs).
  3. KANs are MLPs with spline-basis as the activation function.
  4. KANs do not beat the curse of dimensionality.
