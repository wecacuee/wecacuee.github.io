# ECE 275 --- Sequential Logic Systems
## Fall 2021


Instructors: 	Vikas Dhiman, 105 Barrows, 581-2222, vikas.dhiman@maine.edu
    Office Hours: 4-5:30pm MWF most likely, but feel free to try me anytime during the day
Credits: 3 credits
Web page: https://vikasdhiman.info/ECE275-Sequential-Logic
The course is mostly based on Prof Richard Eason's last year [course](http://web.eece.maine.edu/eason/ece275/).
Text: Fundamentals of Digital Logic with Verilog Design (3rd ed.) by Brown and Vranesic
Prerequisite: ECE 177

### Grading:

    Grades are based on the following:
        - Homework 20%, and Labs 15% -- 35% total
        - Two prelims (about Oct. 5 and about Nov. 9) and quizzes -- 45%
        - Final (Comprehensive) -- 20%

    There will be no make-ups for missed exams.  Plan to be there.
    Late work -- generally not accepted without good reason.

### Approximate Course Outline:

    - The design process (digital systems, rapid prototyping, etc.)
    - Combinational logic (Boolean algebra, truth tables, logic gates, etc.).
    - Introduction to CAD tools, Verilog/VHDL.
    - Implementation technology (transistor switches, NMOS, CMOS, standard chips, PLD's, etc.)
    - Optimization (K-maps, minimization, incompletely specified functions, multiple output circuits, multilevel networks)
    - Number representation and arithmetic circuits.
    - Combinational building blocks (multiplexers, demultiplexers, code converters, etc.)
    - Simple sequential circuits: flip-flops, registers and counters.
    - Synchronous sequential circuits (state diagrams, state tables, Mealy vs. Moore circuits).
    - Design of synchronous circuits using CAD tools.
    - Analysis of clocked sequential networks.
    - State tables (derivation, reduction, and state assignment).
    - Finite state machine optimization.

### Tests
Tests will be closed book, with one A4 size paper as cheat-sheet allowed. Calculators will neither be needed nor allowed.

### Labs

We will have labs throughout the semester. Please attend in person on your assigned lab day. Each student will be provided hardware that can be taken home. By accepting this hardware, the student is agreeing to return the hardware at the end of the semester with shipping pre-paid by the department.

### Academic Honesty Statement
Academic honesty is very important. It is dishonest to cheat on exams, to copy term papers, to submit papers written by another person, to fake experimental results, or to copy or reword parts of books or articles into your own papers without appropriately citing the source. Students committing or aiding in any of these violations may be given failing grades for an assignment or for an entire course, at the discretion of the instructor. In addition to any academic action taken by an instructor, these violations are also subject to action under the University of Maine Student Conduct Code. The maximum possible sanction under the student conduct code is dismissal from the University. Please see the University of Maine System's Academic Integrity Policy listed in the Board Policy Manual as Policy 314: https://www.maine.edu/board-of-trustees/policy-manual/section-314/

Students Accessibility Services Statement: If you have a disability for which you may be requesting an accommodation, please contact Student Accessibility Services, 121 East Annex, 581.2319, as early as possible in the term. Students who have already been approved for accommodations by SAS and have a current accommodation letter should meet with me, Rick Eason, (the instructor of the course) privately as soon as possible.

Course Schedule Disclaimer (Disruption Clause): In the event of an extended disruption of normal classroom activities (due to COVID-19 or other long-term disruptions), the format for this course may be modified to enable its completion within its programmed time frame. In that event, you will be provided an addendum to the syllabus that will supersede this version.

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The virus is transmitted person-to-person through respiratory droplets that are expelled when breathing, talking, eating, coughing or sneezing. Additionally, the virus is stable on surfaces and can be transmitted when someone touches a contaminated surface and transfers the virus to their nose or mouth. When someone becomes infected with COVID-19 they may either have no symptoms or symptoms that range from mild to severe and can even be fatal. During this global pandemic, it is imperative that all students, faculty, and staff abide by the safety protocols and guidelines set forth by the university to ensure the safety of our campus. All students are encouraged to make the Black Bears Care Pact to protect the health of themselves, the health of others, and the college of our hearts always.

Observance of Religious Holidays/Events: The University of Maine recognizes that when students are observing significant religious holidays, some may be unable to attend classes or labs, study, take tests, or work on other assignments. If they provide adequate notice (at least one week and longer if at all possible), these students are allowed to make up course requirements as long as this effort does not create an unreasonable burden upon the instructor, department or University. At the discretion of the instructor, such coursework could be due before or after the examination or assignment. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to a student's grade for the examination, study, or course requirement on the day of religious observance. The student shall not be marked absent from the class due to observing a significant religious holiday. In the case of an internship or clinical, students should refer to the applicable policy in place by the employer or site.

Sexual Violence Policy:

Sexual Discrimination Reporting: The University of Maine is committed to making campus a safe place for students. Because of this commitment, if you tell a teacher about an experience of sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, relationship abuse (dating violence and domestic violence), sexual misconduct or any form of gender discrimination involving members of the campus, your teacher is required to report this information to Title IX Student Services or the Office of Equal Opportunity.

If you want to talk in confidence to someone about an experience of sexual discrimination, please contact these resources:

For confidential resources on campus: Counseling Center: 207-581-1392 or Cutler Health Center: at 207-581-4000.

For confidential resources off campus: Rape Response Services: 1-800-871-7741 or Partners for Peace: 1-800-863-9909.

Other resources: The resources listed below can offer support but may have to report the incident to others who can help:

For support services on campus: Title IX Student Services: 207-581-1406, Office of Community Standards: 207-581-1409, University of Maine Police: 207-581-4040 or 911. Or see the OSAVP website for a complete list of services.
